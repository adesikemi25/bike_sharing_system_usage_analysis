# bike_sharing_system_usage_analysis
This project is about the time series forecasting  analysis of bike sharing system usage. The aim of the project is to analyse the factors that affects the demand for bike sharing system and forecast the future daily and hourly demand for the service.
The objectives of the project are as follows:
i) Analyse the factors that influence bike sharing system usage
ii) Carry out exploratory data analysis on bike usage hourly and daily data
iii) Implement a predictive model(ARIMA) based on the exploratory data analysis findings
iv) Evaluate the model based on performance metrics (MSE, RMSE)
v) Build a model that can forcast the future demand for bike sharing system.
